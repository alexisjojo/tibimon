Tibimon is short for Tibia Monitoring. Tibimon reports your health, mana, position, & skills in an easy to use and read application without breaking any rules. TibiMon will also alert you by sound if you are moved, have low health, or lose your target. It does all of this without getting you a ban or breaking the Tibia rules.

Current Features are Health Monitoring, Skill Monitoring, X,Y,Z Monitoring, Low Health Alert, Move Alert, No Target Alert, & Automatic Updating.

In the future I wish to add FPS managing, Chat monitoring, target health monitoring, etc...
